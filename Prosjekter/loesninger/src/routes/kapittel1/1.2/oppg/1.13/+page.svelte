<h1>Toss A Coin To Your Witcher</h1>

<p class="vers">
    When a humble bard
    Graced a ride along
    With Geralt of Rivia
    Along came this song
</p>

<p class="vers">
    From when the White Wolf fought
    A silver-tongued devil
    His army of elves
    At his hooves did they revel
</p>

<p class="vers">
    They came after me
    With masterful deceit
    Broke down my lute
    And they kicked in my teeth
</p>

<p class="vers">
    While the devil's horns
    Minced our tender meat
    And so cried the Witcher
    He can't be bleat
</p>

<p class="refreng">
    Toss a coin to your Witcher
    Oh, Valley of Plenty
    Oh, Valley of Plenty, oh
    Toss a coin to your Witcher
    Oh, Valley of Plenty
</p>

<p class="vers">
    At the edge of the world
    Fight the mighty horde
    That bashes and breaks you
    And brings you to mourn
</p>

<p class="vers">
    He thrust every elf
    Far back on the shelf
    High up on the mountain
    From whence it came 
</p>

<p class="vers">
    He wiped out your pest
    Got kicked in his chest
    He's a friend of humanity
    So give him the rest
</p>

<p class="vers">
    That's my epic tale
    Our champion prevailed
    Defeated the villain
    Now pour him some ale
</p>

<p class="refreng">
    Toss a coin to your Witcher
    Oh, Valley of Plenty
    Oh, Valley of Plenty, oh
    Toss a coin to your Witcher
    A friend of humanity
</p>

<p class="refreng">
    Toss a coin to your Witcher
    Oh, Valley of Plenty
    Oh, Valley of Plenty, oh
    Toss a coin to your Witcher
    A friend of humanity
</p>

<p class="refreng">
    Toss a coin to your Witcher
    Oh, Valley of Plenty
    Oh, Valley of Plenty, ah-ah, oh
    Toss a coin to your Witcher
    A friend of humanity
